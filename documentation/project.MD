# Architecture

Waveform Factory primarily comprises of a `Pattern` class with subclasses for each type of waveform like SineWave, SquareWave, SawtoothWave, and SmoothWave. Each of these classes contains methods to generate the waveform pattern. The pattern parameters including frequency, amplitude, phase, offset, length, and sample_rate can be customized for each pattern.

The base `Pattern` class ensures that all subclasses follow the same API, making it easy to generate and manipulate different types of waveforms uniformly. The waveform data is returned as a numpy array that represents the generated waveform.

The waveforms can be easily visualized and tested with the help of matplotlib, a powerful Python library for data visualization.

# Development Plan

The development of Waveform Factory is organized into the following stages:

1. **Pattern Development:** We start by developing each waveform pattern as a separate class. We're implementing methods to generate waveform data for the following wave types: sine, square, sawtooth, and smooth.

2. **Testing:** Each pattern class comes with its own set of unit tests to ensure the integrity of the waveform data. We're using pytest for our testing framework and matplotlib for visualizing the waveforms.

3. **Documentation:** Each class and method is fully documented with docstrings. We're following the Numpy docstring format which is widely used in the scientific Python community.

4. **Integration:** After testing, all waveform classes are integrated into the pattern_generator module. This serves as the entry point for generating waveform data.

5. **Deployment:** Once the code is ready and tested, we'll set up a GitHub repository and prepare the package for distribution via PyPI.

6. **Future Enhancements:** In the future, we plan on adding additional waveform types and improving the library based on user feedback. We may also develop a user interface for generating and manipulating waveform data.
